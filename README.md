MagnetClik

After the grueling hours of work at school, you come home to...more work. Great.
MagnetClik is a "clicker" game meant to emulate to balancing act of doing homework and taking care of yourself.
Every night for five days, you have three stats to manage: WORK, ENERGY, and HAPPINESS.
Each night you must finish your WORK while also keeping up your ENERGY and HAPPINESS, all within 50 moves(clicks).
Watch out, as depleting your ENERGY/HAPPINESS on one night will give you a penalty for the next.
Press (w) to work, increasing WORK and decreasing ENERGY and HAPPINESS. Press (e) to eat and (s) to sleep, increasing ENERGY.
And press (p) to procrastinate, decreasing ENERGY and increasing HAPPINESS.
You can choose from three characters to play as, each with different stats and abilities.
At the end of the schoolweek, your nights of completed work will be tallied up, and you will receive a grade for your work!
