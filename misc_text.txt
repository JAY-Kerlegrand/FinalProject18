Intro:
Magnet High School is a prestigious STEM school focused on the discipline of engineering.
Hundreds of students compete vigorously in the selective admission process to be enrolled in the school and further their education in hopes of becoming productive members of society in their near futures.
Exceptâ€¦.
Once in the school, some of these once restful, dutiful students...if ever dutiful at all...become stress-induced, procrastinating balls of sadness.
Congrats! You are one of these pitiful students, and you are trying to skirt by yet another week of homework.
Try to get your work done while also maintaining your energy and happiness!

Directions:
Press (w) to WORK and get sh*t done!
Press (e) to eat
Press (s) to sleep
Press (p) to procrastinate
Press (c) to... cry
Be careful, sleeping and crying may have some consequences...
Stragetize! You've only got __ clicks to get it done, so use 'em wisely!
